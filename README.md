The two files provides the 0D thermal model of a battery in thermal runaway that is immerged in water. The language is Python

The file Thermal-model.py simulates a battery in thermal runaway for specific parameters that can be directly ajusted in the function simulate()
The file Thermal-model-param.py provides a parametrical analysis for parameters such as the ambiant air temperature and the leakage factor. The other parameters can be ajusted via the function simulate()
